“TaxPaymentAnalysis” we used the approach of secondary sort for sorting input. 
In the sorting phase, the input file is sorted based on the sorting order specified by the user.

First it sort the Primary Key i.e., state in ascending order[A to Z] 
Then sort the Secondary Key i.e., tax-amount in descending order [Max to Min].
